# My-first-test-repository
Hi! This repository will be my first test repository, and in this regard, please do not react too strictly, I'm just learning!
I plan to delve into the structure of the phyton and c++ code and if there are those who are interested in students like me then write me an email I will be glad to see you!
email address for contacting me: batyabadufa@gmail.com
Thanks for you!
